# Chordata

Chordata's probably a bad name. I set out to create a script that would allow me to list out all the chords that contained a particular note. For that you need to know all possible scales and chords in all keys. Ugh. Therefore there are two files, scales and chords and they can generate any scale and any chord based on configuration options (which can be tuned) at the top of each script. I'd write some examples but no need - just checkout the jasmine unit tests.

## Harmonization : That's what I built this for
Writing melodies and harmonizing them. Since you can look up any scale, you can reference it to compose a melody and since you can look up any chord that contains a particular note, you have a plethora of chord options way beyond the diatonics.
